## Need help ?

As a former startup CTO, I can help you to design a scalable, reliable, evolutive and documented architecture to help you starting your project.

I strongly believe an infrastructure should deploy in one click with no worries, and I can help you to achieve this with high-end and cutting edge technologies.

For this I can help you to setup efficient lean startup methods, agile development, continuous integration, continuous deployment, Test Driven Development, REST api design, proper algorithm design, automated documentation generation...etc

I am currently speaking and developing fluently with:

 - ruby, rails, grape-api, 
 - mongodb, redis, mysql/postgresql, amazon-dynamodb, neo4j, redshift
 - heroku, amazon aws, capistrano
 - travis, codeship, github
 - hadoop, hive, redshift

Feel free to contact me if you are looking for strong technical foundation to start a project, design a complex web app, setup an high-end cloud environment, design a robust and secure api, or simply if you want to learn a few keys to make everything going smoothly !

It'll be a pleasure to meet you ! <a href="#" onclick="alert('feel free to drop me a mail ! \n mail @ aurelien-herve.com');">contact</a>
